abstract = {The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to duplication of effort and the possibility for error. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a standard catalog of published simulation models from a wide range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage an even broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with plasma lipid traits and have provided new insights into the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism including the identification of novel biological processes. These findings add to a body of existing data on dietary and environmental factors affecting plasma lipids. Here we explore how interactions between genetic risk factors and other phenotypes may explain some of the missing heritability of plasma lipid traits. Recent findings: Recent studies have identified true statistical interaction between several environmental and genetic risk factors and their effects on plasma lipid fractions. These include interactions between behaviors such as smoking or exercise as well as specific dietary nutrients and the effect size of specific genetic variants on plasma lipid traits risk and modifying effects of measures of adiposity on the cumulative impact of a number of common genetic variants on each of plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Summary: Interactions between genetic risk factors and clinical phenotypes may account for some of the unexplained heritability of plasma lipid traits. Recent studies provide biological insight into specific genetic associations and may aid in the identification of dyslipidemic patients for whom specific lifestyle interventions are likely to be most effective.},

abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci robustly associated with plasma lipids, which also contribute to extreme lipid phenotypes. However, these common genetic variants explain less than 12{\%} of variation in lipid traits.  Adiposity is also an important determinant of plasma lipoproteins, particularly plasma triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) concentrations.  Thus, interactions between genes and clinical phenotypes may contribute to this unexplained heritability.  We have applied a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) for each of plasma TGs and HDLc in two large cohorts at the extremes of body mass index (BMI).  Both BMI and GRS were strongly associated with these lipid traits. A significant interaction between obese/lean status and GRS was noted for each of TG (PInteraction = 2.87X10-4) and HDLc (PInteraction = 1.05X10-3). These interactions were largely driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging APOA5, GCKR and LPL for TG, and CETP, GALNT2, LIPG and PLTP for HDLc.  In contrast, the GRSLDLc  X adiposity interaction was not significant. Sexual dimorphism was evident for the GRSHDL on HDLc in obese (PInteraction = 0.016) but not lean subjects. SNP by BMI interactions may provide biological insight into specific genetic associations and missing heritability. },
