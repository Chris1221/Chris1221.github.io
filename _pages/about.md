I'm a student in the [DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics Programme](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics?wssl=1) at the University of Oxford (Exeter College) jointly funded by the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/home) and the [Clarendon Fund](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon/about). 

Currently I am working with [Prof Gerton Lunter](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/gerton-lunter-2) and [Prof Mark McCarthy](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/mark-mccarthy) to understand how the human microbiome interacts with our genome to influence the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. I also have a strong interest in ancient DNA and studying history through the lens of genetics, and am working to understand ancient human population movement using machine learning. During my first year I worked with [Prof. Simon Myers](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/simon-myers/) looking at Neanderthal introgression into human genetics for a research rotation. 

Previously I have worked extensively on developing new kinds of polygenic risk scores, understanding how stratified false disovery rate correction may be used in GWAS, and how gene environment interactions may affect cardiovascular disease. 

I hold an [Honours BSc in Biomedical Science specializing in Biostatistics (COOP)](http://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/honours-bsc-biomedical-scienceoption-biostatistics/) from the University of Ottawa, and did COOP research placements with Drs [Jo Knight](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/knight.html). (at CAMH and the University of Lancaster) and [Frank Dudbridge](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/health-sciences/people/staff-pages/professorial-staff/professor-frank-dudbridge) (at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, now at Leicester University). My thesis was entitled *Optimal Polygenic Prediction of Coronary Artery Disease* and was supervised by [Professor Ruth McPherson](https://www.ottawaheart.ca/physician-researcher-profile/mcpherson-ruth) at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker, though the last is a work in progress.
