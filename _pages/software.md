- [smcsmc](https://github.com/luntergroup/smcsmc) [`c++`, `python`] Inference of the ancestral recombination graph and demographic events from whole genome sequence data.
	- Install with [conda](https://anaconda.org/luntergroup/smcsmc).
- [stdpopsim](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/stdpopsim) [`python`] A community-maintained standard library of population genetic models.
	- Install from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/stdpopsim/).
- [aavcf](https://github.com/Chris1221/aavcf) [`c++`] Convert allelic encodings from major/minor to ancestral/derived in VCF files.
	- Install from source.
- [goldi](https://github.com/Chris1221/goldi) [`c++`, `R`] Identification of multi-word terms (such as in Gene Ontology) in free form text with application to the biomedical literature.
	- Install from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/goldi/index.html).
- [yamldoc](https://github.com/Chris1221/yamldoc) [`python`] A dependency free documentation generator for YAML formatted data.

### Fun projects

- [allerID](https://github.com/Chris1221/allerID) [`R`, `shiny`] Web application to identify allergens in lists of ingredients using [goldi](https://github.com/Chris1221/goldi).
	- Hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://ccole.shinyapps.io/allerID/)
- [rpg_epic_converter](https://github.com/Chris1221/epic_rpg_converter) [`python`] A small discord bot implementing a graph-based conversion strategy between resources in a role playing game, EPIC RPG.
