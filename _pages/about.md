I'm a student in the [DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics?wssl=1) program at the University of Oxford, jointly funded by the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/home) and the [Clarendon Fund](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon/about). I graduated with an Honours BSc in Biomedical Science specializing in Biostatistics from the Univeristy of Ottawa in 2017. 

Currently I am working with [Prof Gerton Lunter](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/gerton-lunter-2) and [Prof Mark McCarthy](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/mark-mccarthy) to understand how genetic variation in the human microbiome may influence our risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. I also study history through the lens of genetics, and am working to understand ancient human population movement using ancient DNA and machine learning. 

Outside of work, I’m an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker, though the last is a work in progress.

我慢慢学中文在牛津语言中心。 我的女朋友是中国人，我们去了北京。
