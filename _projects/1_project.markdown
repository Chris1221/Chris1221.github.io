### Dr. Stephane Aris-Brosou

Alongside Dr Aris-Brosou at the University of Ottawa, I researched the dynamics of viral evolution through approximate Bayesian computing (ABC). Unfortunately, no publications came out of this time, though Stephane was kind enough to introduce me to the world of R and coding, which would come to shape my career.  

For more information on Dr. Aris-Brosou and his research, please consult his [lab website](https://bioinformatics.uottawa.ca/stephane/index.html).
