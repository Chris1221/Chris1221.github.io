### Dr. Jo Knight

I completed three of my four COOP terms doing research with Dr. Knight. Together we constructed a simulation based approach for evaluating if complex variation in the genome impacted the ability of stratified FDR for multiple testing correction in genome wide association studies. These results are formalized in [coRge](https://github.com/Chris1221/coRge) which is released under an MIT license.

Additionally, we worked to create a package [goldi](https://github.com/Chris1221/goldi) for identifying Gene Ontology terms in the literature. This was done as a collaboration with Dr. Etienne Sibelle, though the work eventually took on its own form as it matured. It is currently released as a pre-print, and I have plans to publish it in the near future. 

As a part of this work, which continued into my time at Lancaster University, I had the pleasure of working with Nuwan Hettige on polygenic risk prediction of Schizophrenic medication dosages. Additionally, I assisted in the imputation and analysis of data with Dr. Rachel Tyndale, who's work was just presented at ASHG 2018.
