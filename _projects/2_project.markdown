### Prof. Ruth McPherson

The majority of the research that I did during my undergraduate was done with Professor Ruth McPherson at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. 

I volunteered during much of my second and third year of undergraduate, and returned to complete my thesis at the end of my fifth year.

Together with Dr. Majid Nikpay, we used polygenic risk scores to dissect the risk for obesity, cardiovascular disease, and dyslipidemia. Specifically, we identified gene by environment interactions in dyslipidemia, and found that CAD genetic risk was predictive of obesity in a Mendelian Randomization study. Additionally, I contributed to a review on GxE interactions in dyslipidemia. 

For my thesis, I constructed a polygenic risk score out of several component trait risk scores, and discussed theoretical properties as well as an application using several cohort studies. 

For more details on my published work, see Publications.
