I'm a student in the [DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics?wssl=1) program at the University of Oxford, jointly funded by the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/home) and the [Clarendon Fund](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon/about). I graduated with an Honours BSc in Biomedical Science specializing in Biostatistics from the Univeristy of Ottawa in 2017. 

 

Alongside my supervisors [Gerton Lunter](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/research/research-groups/lunter-group) and [Mark McCarthy](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/mark-mccarthy), I am developing deep learning tools to understand how variation in the human genome affects fundamental cellular processes and disease risk. I am also passionate about using genetics to study history, and am studying ancient human population migrations using a novel particle filter approach for demographic inference.

Outside of work, I am an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker (though the last is a work in progress).

我慢慢学中文在牛津语言中心。 我的女朋友是中国人，我们去了北京。
