### Dr. Jo Knight

I continued my work with Dr. Jo Knight in Lancaster and joined the Data Science Institute for a brief four months. During this time we worked together to further our research into stratified FDR correction and wrote our paper on literature annotation with our software [goldi](https://github.com/Chris1221/goldi). I attended several conferences during this time, including the European Mathematical Genetics Society held in Newcastle.
