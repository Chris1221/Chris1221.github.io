I’m a student in the DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics Programme at the University of Oxford (Exeter College) jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Clarendon Fund. Currently I am working with Prof Gerton Lunter and Prof Mark McCarthy to understand how the human microbiome interacts with our genome to influence the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. I also have a strong interest in ancient DNA and studying history through the lens of genetics, and am working to understand ancient human population movement using machine learning. During my first year I worked with Prof. Simon Myers looking at Neanderthal introgression into human genetics for a research rotation. Previously I have worked extensively on developing new kinds of polygenic risk scores, understanding how stratified false disovery rate correction may be used in GWAS, and how gene environment interactions may affect cardiovascular disease. Please see the links below for an up-to-date record of my publications.

Outside of work, I’m an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker, though the last is a work in progress.
