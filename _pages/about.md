I'm a student in the [DPhil Genomic Medicine and Statistics Programme](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics?wssl=1) at the University of Oxford (Exeter College) jointly funded by the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/home) and the [Clarendon Fund](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon/about). I graduated with an Honours BSC in Biomedical Science specializing in Biostatistics from the Univeristy of Ottawa in 2017. 

Currently I am working with [Prof Gerton Lunter](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/gerton-lunter-2) and [Prof Mark McCarthy](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/mark-mccarthy) to understand how the human microbiome interacts with our genome to influence the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. I also have a strong interest in ancient DNA and studying history through the lens of genetics, and am working to understand ancient human population movement using machine learning. 

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid hiker, coffee enthusiast, and home baker, though the last is a work in progress.
